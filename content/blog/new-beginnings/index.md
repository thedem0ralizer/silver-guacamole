description: This is post about a quote from the classic 1980s movie, Clue

  > Monkey's brains - though popular in Cantonese cuisine - are not often to be found in  Washington, D.C.!

  This is a damning line delivered by Wadsworth to the dinner guest Mrs.
Peacock as he outlined to the rest of the dinner party just how she went about
murdering the cook. The quote probably occurs more than one time in the movie,
because *Clue* offers multiple endings. There is nothing particularly special
about it, other than the punctuated delivery of _"Washington, D.C.!"_

  Clue is the most humorous movie of all time. The writing is phenomenal.
Hopefully, almost four decades after its release in theatres, it can finally
get the recognition it deserves, after the writings on the present blog become
massively consumed by humans throughout the solar system.
